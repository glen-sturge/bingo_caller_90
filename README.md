# bingo_caller_90
Simple program that calls out numbers for 90 ball bingo.
Made this when thinking of uses for the .pop() method.
Would be cool to do in a gui and have the numbers 'light up' on a grid. Will try that later.

# bingo_90(curses)
Basically the same program but completed using the curses library.
It has to be run from  a terminal window or CMD (will not run in an IDE).
This is my first run with curses. It was enjoyable. I hope you like it.
